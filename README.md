A little Elm :heart: Electron project

Today I built the Rock, Paper, Scissors, Lizard, Spock game example from [this example.](https://alpacaaa.net/blog/post/elm-rock-paper-scissors-beginner/)

I especially love the way this project demonstrates using Elm's type system to create only application states that can possibly exist - or to put it another way: [Make impossible state impossible](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IcgmSRJHu_8)
